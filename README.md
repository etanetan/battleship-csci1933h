# Battleship Game Using Java

How to compile: javac Game.java
                java Game

                javac BattleboatsGUI.java
                java BattleboatsGUI

Assumptions:
    The user inputs proper bounds for the battleship game (greater than 2 and less than 11) and user is also inputting an integer

This project taught me a lot and had me work with a GUI for the user to interact with.
